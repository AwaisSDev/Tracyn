          This is the walkthrough for a new customer, start to finish. Every step below is something you
          can click through today, not a roadmap.
        </p>

        <div className="mt-8">
          <Section step={1} title="Create your account and workspace">
            <p>
              Go to the app and sign in with your work email (magic link, no password to set). On first
              login you&apos;ll be asked to name a workspace. One workspace per team or product is typical.
            </p>
          </Section>

          <Section step={2} title="Get an API key">
            <p>
              In the dashboard, open <strong>Settings &rarr; API Keys</strong>. Click <strong>Create key</strong>,
              give it a name that says where it&apos;ll live (e.g. <code>prod-checkout-agent</code>), and
              copy the value shown. It&apos;s only shown once, so store it as an environment variable
              (<code>TRACYN_API_KEY</code>) wherever your agent runs.
            </p>
          </Section>

          <Section step={3} id="sdk" title="Install the SDK">
            <p>One decorator is the whole integration for logging:</p>
            <Code>{`pip install tracyn`}</Code>
            <Code>{`from tracyn import Tracyn

audit = Tracyn(api_key="TRACYN_API_KEY", agent_name="billing-bot")

@audit.track(action_type="external", action_name="send_refund")
def send_refund(customer_id: str, amount_cents: int):
    ...  # your existing function, unchanged`}</Code>
            <p>
              <code>audit.track</code> wraps your function without changing what it does or returns; it
              just reports that the call happened. Inputs and outputs are redacted for common PII, and a
              second automated pass catches secrets or API keys, before the event is ever stored.
            </p>
          </Section>

          <Section step={4} id="policy" title="Decide what needs a human">
            <p>
              Most actions don&apos;t need a human in the loop. Some, like refunds over a threshold or
              anything destructive, should. That&apos;s what <strong>Policy</strong> configures:
            </p>
            <Code>{`rules:
  - match:
      action_name: send_refund
      inputs.amount_cents: { gt: 10000 }
    require_approval: true`}</Code>
            <p>
              Once a rule matches, <code>audit.track</code> blocks (it polls, it doesn&apos;t spin) until
              someone approves or rejects, then your function runs, or doesn&apos;t, and the result is what
              your code sees.
            </p>
          </Section>

          <Section step={5} id="slack" title="Get approvals into Slack">
            <p>
              Without Slack, pending approvals still work: they show up on the Approvals page and, with a
              fallback email set in Settings, as an emailed link. Most teams still connect Slack from
              Settings so anyone in the right channel can approve with one click.
            </p>
          </Section>

          <Section step={6} id="questionnaires" title="Answer a security questionnaire in minutes">
            <p>
              Under Questionnaires, upload a customer&apos;s security or compliance questionnaire (PDF,
              DOCX, or plain text). Tracyn parses out individual questions, finds your actual logged
              events that are relevant evidence for each one, and drafts a cited answer. You review and
              edit every answer before exporting; nothing goes to a customer without a human reading it
              first.
            </p>
          </Section>

          <Section step={7} id="soc2" title="What SOC 2 mapping actually gives you">
            <p>
              The SOC 2 page maps common Trust Services Criteria to what Tracyn is logging for you.
              It&apos;s a starting point for your own audit prep, not a certification. Talk to an auditor
              before making that claim externally.
            </p>
          </Section>

          <Section step={8} id="mcp" title="Ask Claude, ChatGPT, or Grok about your audit trail">
            <p>
              Tracyn also runs as an MCP server, so you can ask an AI assistant things like
              &ldquo;anything waiting on me?&rdquo; or &ldquo;what did the billing agent do last
              night?&rdquo; directly. It reads the same record as the dashboard, and it can only read.
              Two ways to connect, depending on which assistant:
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Claude.ai, ChatGPT, or Grok</strong> (hosted, no install): these run in the browser
              with no local machine to install anything on, so they connect to Tracyn&apos;s own
              hosted MCP endpoint instead. Add a custom connector pointing at your deployed
              backend&apos;s <code>/mcp</code> path, using your Tracyn API key as the bearer token
              when prompted.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Claude Desktop or Claude Code</strong> (local): these run as a process on your own
              machine, so they can run the server directly:
            </p>
            <Code>{`pip install tracyn-mcp`}</Code>
            <Code>{`{
  "mcpServers": {
    "tracyn": {
      "command": "tracyn-mcp",
      "env": { "TRACYN_API_KEY": "al_live_..." }
    }
  }
}`}</Code>
          </Section>
        </div>

        <div className="mt-4 border-t border-border pt-8 text-[15px] text-muted-foreground">
          <p>
            The SDK also ships an offline <code>tracyn</code> CLI for validating a policy file before
            it ships, and supports async functions the same way as sync ones. Stuck on something not
