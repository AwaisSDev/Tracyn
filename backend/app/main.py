Compliance infrastructure for AI agent teams: logging, human approvals,
an immutable audit trail, and evidence-pack generation.

## Authentication

Two separate schemes, depending on the caller:

- **SDK / API-key routes** (`/v1/events`, `/v1/approvals/request`,
  `/v1/approvals/{approval_id}/status`, `/v1/sdk/policy`, `/v1/mcp/*`):
  send `Authorization: Bearer <your al_live_... key>`. Create a key from
  the dashboard's Settings page.
- **Dashboard / human routes** (everything under `/v1/workspaces/{id}/...`
  except the SDK-facing ones above): send
  `Authorization: Bearer <Supabase session JWT>`, the same token the
  dashboard's own browser session uses.

## Where to start

Most integrations only ever need the Python SDK (`pip install tracyn`)
rather than calling this API directly. See its README for the
`@audit.track(...)` decorator. This reference is for the SDK's own
internals, the MCP server, or a direct integration in another language.

# ChatGPT, and Grok's custom-connector flows can reach it (none of them can
# reach a stdio-only server — see docs/PRODUCTION_READINESS.md). A caller
# can authenticate either way: paste an existing Tracyn API key
# directly as the bearer token (still works, unchanged), or go through the
# real OAuth flow below, which a plain static token can't offer -- some
# clients' own "Connect" buttons (Claude Code's, notably) only know how to
# do OAuth and have no field to paste a token into at all. Either way ends
# up authenticated as a real, revokable API key, checked the same way.

# protected-resource path in particular is defined relative to the
# origin's root, not to whatever sub-path the resource itself lives
# under. Mounting the whole thing under "/mcp" instead would nest every
# one of those paths an extra level (discovered as
# /mcp/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource/mcp, /mcp/authorize, etc.)
# while the auto-generated metadata still advertises the un-nested
# versions -- confirmed by actually running the full discovery ->
# registration -> authorize -> token exchange handshake and watching it
# 404 before this fix. The actual MCP protocol endpoint itself still ends
# up at exactly "/mcp" (see streamable_http_path in tracyn_mcp/server.py),
# same external URL as before -- only the OAuth routes' position changes.
