"""Secondary redaction pass via Claude Haiku.

Presidio (redaction.py) catches structured PII (emails, SSNs, credit cards...)
using regex + NER. It misses things that only make sense in context — API
keys, internal customer names mentioned in prose, business-sensitive
figures. Haiku is cheap and fast enough to run per-event and catch those.

This is deliberately *not* a separate "what kind of action is this" classifier:
action_type is explicit input from the SDK/developer (used by the policy
engine), so there's nothing to infer there. Folding "classification" into a
second redaction pass keeps this to one job instead of two.
