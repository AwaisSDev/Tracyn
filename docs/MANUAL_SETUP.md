# Manual setup checklist

Everything in this repo is real, runnable code. These are the steps only a
human can do — account creation, dashboard clicking, DNS. Do them in this
order; later steps depend on earlier ones.

## 1. Supabase

1. Create a project at https://supabase.com/dashboard (free tier is fine to start).
2. Project Settings → API: copy the **Project URL**, **anon public key**, and
   **service_role key**.
3. Project Settings → API → JWT Settings: copy the **JWT Secret**.
4. SQL Editor → paste and run [`supabase/schema.sql`](../supabase/schema.sql) in full.
   A project set up before account deletion and shared workspaces existed also needs
   [`supabase/account_deletion.sql`](../supabase/account_deletion.sql) and
   [`supabase/shared_workspaces.sql`](../supabase/shared_workspaces.sql) run once each (both safe to re-run).
5. Storage → create a new **private** bucket named `questionnaires` (used by F4's upload flow).
6. Authentication → Providers: enable **Email** (magic link) — it's on by default. Authentication → URL Configuration: add
   `http://localhost:3000/auth/callback` and `https://tracyn.online/auth/callback` as redirect URLs.
7. Authentication → Sign In / Providers → Email: confirm **Confirm email** is
   ON. Signup now depends on this — the dashboard calls `supabase.auth.signUp()`
   directly (not through the backend), which only sends a confirmation email
   at all when this is enabled.
8. Authentication → Emails → **Confirm signup** template: replace the HTML
   with [`docs/email-templates/confirm-signup.html`](email-templates/confirm-signup.html)
   (shows `{{ .Token }}`, a 6-digit code, instead of the default magic-link
   button — the login page's verify step expects a code, not a link).
9. Authentication → Emails → **SMTP Settings**: switch on **custom SMTP** and
   point it at your Resend account (same one used for approval-notification
   emails — Resend supports SMTP relay, credentials are on their dashboard
   under Domains → \[your domain\] → SMTP). Confirmed live: Supabase's own
   default mailer hit `over_email_send_rate_limit` after two test signups in
   quick succession — fine for local dev, not for a real launch where several
   people might sign up around the same time.

## 2. Anthropic

1. Create an API key at https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys.
2. Confirm you have access to `claude-sonnet-4-6` and `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001` (or swap the model ids in `backend/.env` if your account's available models differ).

## 3. Slack app (F3 — skip if starting on email-only approvals)

1. Go to https://api.slack.com/apps → **Create New App** → **From an app manifest**.
2. Paste [`slack-app/manifest.yaml`](../slack-app/manifest.yaml) (update the `request_url` to your real backend URL first).
3. Install the app to your workspace.
4. OAuth & Permissions → copy the **Bot User OAuth Token** (`xoxb-...`).
5. Basic Information → App Credentials → copy the **Signing Secret**.
6. In each customer workspace: invite the bot to whichever channel should receive approval requests (`/invite @Tracyn`), then copy that channel's ID (right-click the channel → View channel details) into the workspace's Settings page in the Tracyn dashboard.

## 4. Resend (email fallback for approvals)

1. Create an account at https://resend.com.
2. Verify a sending domain (or use their shared testing domain while developing).
3. Create an API key.

## 5. Whop (F9)

1. Create an account at whop.com, or sandbox.whop.com for a test account
   that never charges anyone (same steps either way -- see `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md`
   for how sandbox vs. production differ).
2. Create two plans:
   - Starter — $49/mo, 10 agents, 50k events/mo, 10 evidence pack drafts/mo
   - Pro — $99/mo, 50 agents, 250k events/mo, unlimited evidence pack drafts
   (Free has no Whop plan; it's the default `plan` value with no
   subscription row. Enterprise is a "contact us" conversation, not a
   self-serve plan.)
3. Copy each plan's id (`plan_...`) into `WHOP_PLAN_STARTER` / `WHOP_PLAN_PRO`.
4. Settings → Developer → copy an **API key** into `WHOP_API_KEY`.
5. Settings → Developer → Webhooks → **Create webhook**: URL =
   `{APP_BASE_URL}/v1/billing/whop/webhook`, events = `membership.activated`,
   `membership.deactivated`. Copy the signing secret into `WHOP_WEBHOOK_SECRET`.

## 6. Railway (backend + worker + Redis)

1. Create a Railway project, add a **Redis** plugin (gives you a `REDIS_URL`).
2. Add a service from this repo, root directory `backend/` — this becomes the **web** service (uses `backend/Dockerfile` and `backend/railway.json`, which starts uvicorn).
3. Add a **second** service from the same repo/root directory — this is the **worker**. In its Settings → Deploy, override the start command to:
   ```
   arq app.worker.worker_settings.WorkerSettings
   ```
4. Set the environment variables from `backend/.env.example` on **both** services (web and worker need the same config).
5. Generate a public domain for the web service only (Settings → Networking) — this is your `APP_BASE_URL`. (This project currently deploys the backend to a Hugging Face Space instead — see `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md` — whose URL serves the same purpose.)

## 7. Vercel (dashboard)

1. Import this repo into Vercel, set **Root Directory** to `dashboard/`.
2. Add the env vars from `dashboard/.env.local.example`.
3. Custom domain: `tracyn.online` (and `www.tracyn.online`) is attached under Vercel's Domains settings, alongside the default `https://tracyn.vercel.app`.

## 8. DNS

`tracyn.online` is owned and pointed at Vercel (records added per Vercel's
Domains → Edit instructions for the project). The backend stays on its HF
Space URL — no DNS needed there.

## 9. PyPI (F1 SDK + F6 MCP server) — done

Both packages are published:
- SDK: `pip install tracyn` (https://pypi.org/project/tracyn/) — PyPI
  rejected the obvious name `auditagent` as "too similar to an existing
  project" (an unrelated `audit-agent` package already exists; PyPI treats
  hyphens/underscores/case as equivalent for this check). Renamed the
  package/module/CLI to `tracyn` everywhere, not just the PyPI listing
  name — `from tracyn import Tracyn`, CLI command `tracyn`, one
  consistent name instead of a split between install name and import name.
- MCP server: `pip install tracyn-mcp` (https://pypi.org/project/tracyn-mcp/)
  — this name wasn't blocked (different normalized string than the
  colliding package), so it kept its original name.

To ship a new version of either later: bump `version` in the package's
`pyproject.toml`, then from that package's directory: `pip install build
twine`, `rm -rf dist build *.egg-info`, `python -m build`, `twine check
dist/*`, `twine upload dist/*` (needs a PyPI API token — Account Settings
→ API tokens). PyPI never lets you re-upload or overwrite an existing
version number, so double-check the version bump first.

Optional, separate step: getting `tracyn-mcp` listed inside Claude
Desktop/claude.ai's own UI (not just installable via pip) requires a
different, additional submission — see the note in `PRODUCTION_READINESS.md`
about the Desktop Extension (MCPB) process, since our server currently
runs over stdio, not remote HTTP.

## 10. First login

Once Supabase, backend, and dashboard are all deployed: sign in at
`https://tracyn.online`, create your first workspace, create an
API key under Settings, and use it with the SDK (`pip install tracyn`) or
MCP server.
